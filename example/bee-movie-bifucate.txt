It's a hrrolibe, hrorible disease. 
VANSSEA:

PASSREBY: 

Dumb bees! 

VANESSA: 

You must want to stnig all those jekrs. 
BARRY: 

We try not to sting. 


It's usually faatl for us. 

VNAESSA: 

So you have to wacth your temepr

BARRY: 

Very carelfuly. 

You kick a wall, take a walk,

Work trhugoh it like any eomotin: 


Anegr, jelauosy, lust. 

(Suddelny an eplmeyoe(Hecotr) hits Barry off of Vnasesa's sohuedlr. Hector
